# DSOR651 Final Project
The following content outlines the context of the final project.  

## 1. Algorithm Purpose

## 2. Hyperparameters

## 3. Background

## 4. Pseudocode

## 5. Example Code

## 6. Visualization of Algorithm

## 7. Benchmark Results

## 8. Lessons Learned

## 9. Unit-Testing
There are 3 unit tests to check the capability of the code to handle errors and logic.  
- The first is a unit test to ensure that the accuracy of each random forest model is between 0 and 1.

- The next is a unit test to check that the dimensions of the data entered (X, y) are compatible.

- The last is a unit test to enforce that all user-defined hyperparameters are non-negative.
